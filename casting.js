// There are times when working with types where it's necessary to override the type of a variable, such as when incorrect types are provided by a library.
// Casting is the process of overriding a type.
// A straightforward way to cast a variable is using the as keyword, which will directly change the type of the given variable.
var x = 'hello';
console.log(x.length);
// Using <> works the same as casting with as.
var y = 'hello';
console.log(y.length);
